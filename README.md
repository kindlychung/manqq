# Requirements

* Operating system: Linux. This packeage relies on some linux utilities for text processing (sed, cut etc).
It's possible to install these tools on Windows through MinGW or Cygwin, but I haven't tried it.
* R packages: You need devtools to get started.

# Installation

    require(devtools)
    install_github("mhplot", username="kindlychung")
    install_github("bedcollr", username="kindlychung")
